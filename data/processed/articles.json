    "title": "Information about Wegovy",
    "body": "We understand this is an initial step in your weight loss journey towards healthy living, and we\u2019re here for every bump in the road. Just let us know if you have any worries, feedback or questions. As a first step, it\u2019s important for you to take the time to read the manufacturer\u2019s patient information leaflet enclosed in your box. This gives you everything you need to know about how to take the medication, what to avoid, side effects and potential interactions with other medications. What is Wegovy Wegovy contains a hormone called GLP-1 that occurs naturally in the gut. Its purpose is to regulate appetite and provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period, helping to reduce cravings and keep you satisfied after meals. By targeting the receptors responsible for appetite in the brain, this medication helps to lower the body's natural \u2018set point\u2019, which is the weight it strives to maintain. Since Wegovy reduces your appetite, it gives you the opportunity to make healthier choices and reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss. How does Wegovy work? In a nutshell 1. Reduces appetite\u2014so you are less hungry 2. Reduces cravings\u2014so it\u2019s easier to make healthy choices 3. Reduces your set point\u2014so you can lose more weight before starting to plateau Wegovy Titrations Wegovy is available in 5 different dose strengths \u2013 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg & 2.4mg. You start Wegovy at a dose of 0.25 mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks until you reach 1mg. It is essential that your starting dose is 0.25mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment. If you'd like to, you can also increase to 1.7mg and 2.4mg for enhanced appetite suppression but this is optional. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience. How to take Wegovy? You need to inject Wegovy once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin. It should be injected in the abdomen (keep 5cm away from your belly button), upper legs or upper arms. We advise you to mix up your injection sites each week to minimise discomfort. Watch our video about how to take Wegovy before you start your treatment: How to take Wegovy How to store Wegovy You can keep the pen for 6 weeks when stored at a temperature below 30\u00b0C or in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze your medication and keep it away from the freezer compartment. When you are not using the pen, keep the pen cap on in order to protect it from light. Please do not use your medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless. You should start using your treatment within 7 days of receiving it and finish using it within 6 weeks from the date on the Voy pharmacy label applied to your medication. Once you\u2019ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you\u2019re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. These instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box which you\u2019ll receive within your order.",

    "title": "Information about Mounjaro",
    "body": "What is Mounjaro Mounjaro is a new medication that activates the receptors of two hormones found in the digestive tract known as GLP-1 and GIP which increase after we eat. They combine to provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period. By also targeting receptors in the brain it helps to lower the \u2018set point\u2019 which is the weight it ordinarily strives to maintain. Mounjaro gives you the opportunity and makes it easier to opt for healthier choices to reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss. If you would like to know even more about how Mounjaro works you can learn more from the following site: Mounjaro.com. How does Mounjaro work? In a nutshell: Reduces appetite \u2013 so you are less hungry Reduces cravings \u2013 so it\u2019s easier to make healthy choices Reduces your set point \u2013 so you can lose more weight before reaching a plateau Mounjaro Titrations Mounjaro comes in six different dose strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg and 15mg. You\u2019ll start Mounjaro at a dose of 2.5mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks, automatically, until you reach the full dose of 15mg by month 6. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience. Unless otherwise agreed with a clinician, it is essential that your starting dose is 2.5mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment. If you do not want to increase your dose every 4 weeks, please speak to our Medical Team or Customer Care Team, and we'll update your subscription. Why is there excess liquid after my fourth dose? Every Mounjaro Kwikpen comes with four doses of medication and enough liquid to prime your pen before every dose. This means that you will see an excess of liquid in your pen after you\u2019ve taken your four doses. This is to be expected and should not be something to worry about. Please do not attempt to take more than 4 doses of your medication, attempting to use your pen more than four times will lock your pen and you\u2019ll no longer be able to access the liquid. Where can I find the expiry date for my Mounjaro pen? You can find the expiry date of your medication on the side of your medication box. This will be shown as \u2018EXP: DATE\u2019. The expiry date refers to the end of the month that is noted. How do I take Mounjaro? Mounjaro is injected once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin, in the subcutaneous fat. It should be injected in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm (it\u2019s advisable to rotate to a slightly different part of your body each time you inject, this minimises potential discomfort/irritation). Please note that the medication is contained within the clear chamber in the pen, not the individual needles \u2013 these are used to deliver each dose. Watch our step-by-step guide on how to take your Mounjaro before you start your treatment: How to take Mounjaro How to store your Mounjaro You should store Mounjaro in the refrigerator between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). If needed, each pen can be stored at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C ( 86\u00b0F) for up to 30 days. Once you've started the pen, it must be used within 30 days of the first dose. These instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box provided with each order. Do not use this medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless (slightly yellow). Once you\u2019ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you\u2019re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.",

        "question": "What happens during Voy's approval process?",
        "ideal_answer": "Voy's approval process has 3 steps: 1) Complete two tasks (upload a full-length photo and ID photo), 2) Clinical review of your photos and medical history, and 3) Follow-up if needed. If approved, medication is dispatched in 1-3 working days. If not approved, your order is canceled and payments are released within 5 days."
